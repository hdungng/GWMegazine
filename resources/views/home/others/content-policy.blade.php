            <div class="policy-desc mt-5">
                <p>Reddit is a vast network of communities that are created, run, and populated by you, the Reddit
                    users.
                </p>
                <p>Through these communities, you can post, comment, vote, discuss, learn, debate, support, and connect
                    with
                    people who share your interests, and we encourage you to find—or even create—your home on Reddit.
                </p>
                <p>While not every community may be for you (and you may find some unrelatable or even offensive), no
                    community should be used as a weapon. Communities should create a sense of belonging for their
                    members,
                    not
                    try to diminish it for others. Likewise, everyone on Reddit should have an expectation of privacy
                    and
                    safety, so please respect the privacy and safety of others.</p>
                <p>Every community on Reddit is defined by its users. Some of these users help manage the community as
                    moderators. The culture of each community is shaped explicitly, by the community rules enforced by
                    moderators, and implicitly, by the upvotes, downvotes, and discussions of its community members.
                    Please
                    abide by the rules of communities in which you participate and do not interfere with those in which
                    you
                    are
                    not a member.</p>
                <p>Below the rules governing each community are the platform-wide rules that apply to everyone on
                    Reddit.
                    These rules are enforced by us, the admins.</p>
                <p>Reddit and its communities are only what we make of them together, and can only exist if we operate
                    by a
                    shared set of rules. We ask that you abide by not just the letter of these rules, but the spirit as
                    well.
                </p>
